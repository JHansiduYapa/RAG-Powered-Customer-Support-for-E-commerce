Tel: 076 8544607 / 0112 199744 If I can't come, can you send the replacement item(s) or working item(s) via a courier service and should I pay for the courier company? Yes, TRONIC.LK can send the item(s) via courier service and you need to pay the courier fee. What happens if TRONIC.LK finds the item working? TRONIC.LK will send you a video as a proof and you have to pay for the time involved in testing. Current fee as of 01/01/2024 is Rs. 1,000 per hour. What happens if we find you have burned it due to misuse?\nThen we will ask you to hand over materials we need to perform the test including the modules, sensors and development boards in brand new condition along with the cost involved. The cost must always be paid beforehand. Once we receive the payment along with the requested items, our engineering team will perform the test and submit a test report to you including photos, videos, connection diagrams and source codes. What if we found a module or sensor sold by us is malfunctioning? In this case, we will replace those free of charge and finally give you a fully working system. What if we found a module or sensor sold by a 3rd party is malfunctioning? In this case, you need to supply us the replacement within 2 days, so our engineering team can proceed with the test."

Inverters As per the conditions (4), (5), (6), (9) above, make sure not to connect grid power to the output of the Inverter which will damage it permanently As per condition (10) above, make sure to use proper batteries with correct voltage. Do not use damaged or substandard batteries As per the condition (10) above, do not exceed the half (1/2) of the marked output peak wattage. For example, if you use a 5kW inverter, the maximum you can use continuously is 2.5kW. Exceeding this will make the inverter to heat up and damage the components inside.\nWeekday are working days from Monday to Friday\n\nWarranty We provide warranty for some of the products we sell as below only against manufacturing defects. Electronic modules: 6 Months Warranty Electronic Tools: 6 Months Warranty 3D Printers: 1 Year Warranty (except physical damages due to misuse, high voltages, etc...) Passive components such as ICs, Transistors, FETs, Triacs, Diacs, Diodes, Inductors, Capacitors, Resistors, Bridge rectifiers, Fuses, etc... are not covered with warranty. As per the norms in the technology industry, warranty will be void under certain circumstances mentioned below in this document under Warranty Terms & Conditions. For example, devices such as Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU (ESP8266, ESP32) have all the GPIO pins at 3.3V TTL level. If you connect an Arduino module with 5V TTL level without properly using level shifters / level convertors or at least dividers, that will easily burn the development board voiding warranty.
