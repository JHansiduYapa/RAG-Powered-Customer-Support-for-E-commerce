Tel: 076 8544607 / 0112 199744 If I can't come, can you send the replacement item(s) or working item(s) via a courier service and should I pay for the courier company? Yes, TRONIC.LK can send the item(s) via courier service and you need to pay the courier fee. What happens if TRONIC.LK finds the item working? TRONIC.LK will send you a video as a proof and you have to pay for the time involved in testing. Current fee as of 01/01/2024 is Rs. 1,000 per hour. What happens if we find you have burned it due to misuse?\nOne is to request a refund and the other is to request a replacement. See (3) if you can't come to collect the replacement. What happens if I neglect to pay the expenses? To avoid further losses, TRONIC.LK will remove you from the system and stop further interactions Why does TRONIC.LK charge for technical support? You need to pay for the time spent on your work by our technical staff. WARRANTY TERMS & CONDITIONS Warranty will be void if one or many of the following conditions have met.

Electronic modules: 6 Months Warranty Electronic Tools: 6 Months Warranty 3D Printers: 1 Year Warranty (except physical damages due to misuse, high voltages, etc...) Passive components such as ICs, Transistors, FETs, Triacs, Diacs, Diodes, Inductors, Capacitors, Resistors, Bridge rectifiers, Fuses, etc... are not covered with warranty. As per the norms in the technology industry, warranty will be void under certain circumstances mentioned below in this document under Warranty Terms & Conditions. For example, devices such as Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU (ESP8266, ESP32) have all the GPIO pins at 3.3V TTL level. If you connect an Arduino module with 5V TTL level without properly using level shifters / level convertors or at least dividers, that will easily burn the development board voiding warranty.
