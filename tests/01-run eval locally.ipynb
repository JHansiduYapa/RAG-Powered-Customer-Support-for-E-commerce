      "\n",
      "3. Network with domain experts: Once you have researched existing projects and networked with domain experts, you will have a better understanding of the types of projects that are currently being worked on in those areas, as well as the skills and experience required to successfully build and execute such projects.\n",
      "4. Apply for internships or entry-level positions: Once you have a good understanding of the types of projects that are currently being worked on in those areas, as well as the skills and experience required to successfully build and execute such projects, apply for internships or entry-level positions in those areas. This will give you an opportunity to gain hands-on experience building and executing projects in those areas, as well as developing your skills and experience in those areas.\n",
      "5. Evaluate and refine your project ideas: Once you have gained hands-on experience building and executing projects in those areas, as well as developing your skills and experience in those areas, evaluate and refine your project ideas. This will give you a better understanding of the types of projects that are currently being worked on in those areas, as well as the skills and experience required to successfully build and execute such projects.\n",
      "6. Consider building your own projects: Once you have evaluated and refined your project ideas, consider building your own projects. This will give you an opportunity to develop your skills and experience in building and executing projects, as well as gain hands-on experience building and executing your own projects.\n",
      "7. Seek out opportunities for collaboration or mentorship: Once you have built your own projects, seek out opportunities for collaboration or mentorship. This will give you an opportunity to learn from others who have more experience building and executing projects, as well as gain valuable insights and perspectives on the challenges and opportunities facing the field of AI.\n",
      "8. Continuously update and refine your skills and knowledge: Finally, it is important to continuously update and refine your skills and knowledge in the field of AI. This will give you an opportunity to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and advancements in the field of AI, as well as gain valuable insights and perspectives on the challenges and opportunities facing the field of AI.\n",

      "Once upon a time, in a small, ancient kingdom named by its people rather than a name that evokes any notion of modernity or grandeur, there lived a community of animals and humans who lived together harmoniously. This was not the best of times, as the kingdom had been on the brink of collapse due to a series of natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and societal ills.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, an old, wise man named Ophelia decided to step in and save her people. She had come from afar to protect their offspring from the impending disaster. As she led them to safety, she met numerous creatures who greeted her with a mix of curiosity and confusion. One such creature was a group of animals that lived on the edge of extinction—a rare species known as \"The Viperones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ophelia explained the situation to the Veptines, they realized that their true purpose was not just survival but also a way of life. Their members were wise creatures who had been selected by Ophelia for their intelligence and wisdom, and they would lead them through trials that tested their strength, endurance, and ability to work together as one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Veptines started off cautiously, forming small groups that would face challenges such as theVeptine flu (a deadly illness that seemed to only target humans) or theVeptine fire. But as they faced these tests, they learned how to rely on each other, how to build trust with animals who did not trust them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One particularly challenging encounter was theVeptine storm, which arrived late in their journey. The storm was so strong that it threatened to destroy their home. Despite this, the Veptines emerged from the storm intact, stronger and more resilient than they had been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ophelia watched the Veptines, she realized that they were not just animals—they were a people. They shared a bond of trust, respect, and care with each other, and their strength was greater than any single creature could have known or needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the Veptines had not only saved their people but also left behind an incredible legacy—a community of strong, resilient beings who had shown that true survival often required working together, trusting one another, and finding common ground beyond just survival."

The ability to collaborate \\nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \\nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \\n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)\\n1. Teamwork:\\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \\nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \\nthat borders on horrific. I’d much rather stay home and read \\na book. Nonetheless, I’m fortunate to have found many \\ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \\nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \\nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \\nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \\nlieu of networking, I’ve found it more helpful to think about \\nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \\nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \\ncommunities that I’m part of. This has the side effect of \\nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. \\n2.

While the \\nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — \\nand coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these \\nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \\nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.\\nLearning foundational skills is a career-long process:\\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s \\ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\nWorking on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different \\nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to \\neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.\\nInconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: \\nCHAPTER 1\\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community.

The ability to collaborate \\nwith, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. \\nThus, interpersonal and communication skills really matter. \\n(I used to be a pretty bad communicator, by the way.)\\n1. Teamwork:\\nI hate networking! As an introvert, having to go to a party \\nto smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity \\nthat borders on horrific. I’d much rather stay home and read \\na book. Nonetheless, I’m fortunate to have found many \\ngenuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for \\nand who I count on as well. No person is an island, and \\nhaving a strong professional network can help propel you \\nforward in the moments when you need help or advice. In \\nlieu of networking, I’ve found it more helpful to think about \\nbuilding up a community. So instead of trying to build up \\nmy personal network, I focus instead on building up the \\ncommunities that I’m part of. This has the side effect of \\nhelping me meet more people and make friends as well. \\n2.

In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\nWorking on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them.

It happens in our community even among accomplished people. If you’ve \\nnever experienced this yourself, that’s great! I hope you’ll join me in encouraging and welcoming \\neveryone who wants to join our community.\\nAI is technically complex, and it has its fair share of smart and highly capable people. But it is \\neasy to forget that to become good at anything, the first step is to suck at it. If you’ve succeeded \\nat sucking at AI — congratulations, you’re on your way!\\nI once struggled to understand the math behind linear regression. I was mystified when \\nlogistic regression performed strangely on my data, and it took me days to find a bug in my \\nimplementation of a basic neural network. Today, I still find many research papers challenging \\nto read, and I recently made an obvious mistake while tuning a neural network hyperparameter \\n(that fortunately a fellow engineer caught and fixed).\\nSo if you, too, find parts of AI challenging, it’s okay. We’ve all been there.

While the \\nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — \\nand coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these \\nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \\nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.\\nLearning foundational skills is a career-long process:\\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s \\ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\nWorking on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different \\nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to \\neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.\\nInconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: \\nCHAPTER 1\\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \\nallies who can help you — and who you strive to help — makes the path easier.

Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently \\nvaluable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This \\nincludes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and \\nbusiness metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often \\nmost comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. \\nBut we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up \\nwith business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, \\nrevenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be \\nreduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren’t able to determine \\nreasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more \\nabout the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the \\nmissing perspective.\\nAssess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine \\nwhether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, \\nwhat competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept \\nimplementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain \\nexperts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the \\npotential solutions mentioned above).\\nBudget for resources. Think through everything you’ll need to get the \\nproject done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or \\nsupport you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds \\nto purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.\\nWorking on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is \\ninfeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain \\nthat excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it \\nthrough project work — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field.

While the \\nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — \\nand coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these \\nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \\nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.\\nLearning foundational skills is a career-long process:\\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s \\ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\nWorking on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different \\nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to \\neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.\\nInconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: \\nCHAPTER 1\\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community.

Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently \\nvaluable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This \\nincludes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and \\nbusiness metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often \\nmost comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. \\nBut we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up \\nwith business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, \\nrevenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be \\nreduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren’t able to determine \\nreasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more \\nabout the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the \\nmissing perspective.\\nAssess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine \\nwhether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, \\nwhat competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept \\nimplementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain \\nexperts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the \\npotential solutions mentioned above).\\nBudget for resources. Think through everything you’ll need to get the \\nproject done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or \\nsupport you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds \\nto purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.\\nWorking on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is \\ninfeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain \\nthat excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it \\nthrough project work — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field.

Once you understand a problem, you can \\nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently.
