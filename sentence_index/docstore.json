Even though they mostly deliver packages in the following day, their guarantee is to deliver within 1 to 4 working days. Every parcel we send via the courier service carries a tracking number where you can find the location of the package by calling the courier service (to the branch closer to your location). More than 97% of the parcels we send are less than 1kg. When you place your order, you\u2019ll see the courier charge for 1kg and we will manually adjust the courier charge if the weight is more than 1kg later on. After you submit your order by selecting Bank-in option, we'll prepare your order. If you've placed your order before 1:00PM in a working day, we will prepare it on the same day.

QUICK DELIVERY (PICKME FLASH / UBER PACKAGE) If you need our products delivered quickly and you are in Colombo district, you can use Uber / Pickme Flash motorbike/three-wheeler Delivery service. It not only saves cost, but also saves time. Delivery via motorbikes are bit cheaper than three-wheelers, so unless motorbikes are not available, don\u2019t select three-wheelers. You will be able to collect your order in a short period of time (mostly within an hour) and you can track the driver in your Uber / Pickme app. Here is how you could do that. First, you need to place an online order by entering \u201cUber / Pickme collection\u201d in the comments box which appears at the end of the ordering process. One of our staff members will prepare your order, remove courier charge and send you bank details via email. You need to do the payment only for the items (mention the last 4 digits of the order number as the bank reference), reply to the email with a payment proof and open Uber / Pickme app in your mobile phone and place a collection request. You need to set source location as TRONIC.LK, Nugegoda and contact telephone number as 076 4485607 / 0112 199744. Set destination as your collection point and then compare the charges for motorbikes and three-wheelers. When you confirm the delivery, we will receive an SMS containing contact details of the driver / vehicle and we will only hand over the parcel to the exact driver and vehicle. That\u2019s all. You will get your order in a very short period of time.

Idea to Production Our vision is to become a resource provider to make your product dreams come true which in turn will help up to some extent to make Sri Lanka a production country than a country of junk imports. We already aware of very talented engineers around the country who can surely do an impact for this purpose. We will do our best to make things happen.\n\nTesting As technology enthusiasts ourselves, we would always like to test the modules and sensors we sell. We usually do random testing of the modules and sensors we sell to understand the capabilities of those. Some of customers want us to do testing of the modules they buy for many reasons. One of the popular reasons is to get those tested by safe hands so they have no risk. We always accept such requests at a reasonable cost. The first thing you need to do is, submit a test request to projects@lankatronics.lk. Then we will ask you to hand over materials we need to perform the test including the modules, sensors and development boards in brand new condition along with the cost involved. The cost must always be paid beforehand. Once we receive the payment along with the requested items, our engineering team will perform the test and submit a test report to you including photos, videos, connection diagrams and source codes. What if we found a module or sensor sold by us is malfunctioning? In this case, we will replace those free of charge and finally give you a fully working system. What if we found a module or sensor sold by a 3rd party is malfunctioning? In this case, you need to supply us the replacement within 2 days, so our engineering team can proceed with the test. If you have further questions, feel free to contact us via projects@lankatronics.lk.\n\nTracking To track your parcel, please visit the tracking page of Prompt Xpress courier service below and enter the provided tracking number by us. https://promptxpress.lk/TrackItem.aspx Please note that the tracking number will be sent via email on the next weekday before 11:00AM after we handover the package to courier service. Weekday are working days from Monday to Friday\n\nWarranty We provide warranty for some of the products we sell as below only against manufacturing defects. Electronic modules: 6 Months Warranty Electronic Tools: 6 Months Warranty 3D Printers: 1 Year Warranty (except physical damages due to misuse, high voltages, etc...) Passive components such as ICs, Transistors, FETs, Triacs, Diacs, Diodes, Inductors, Capacitors, Resistors, Bridge rectifiers, Fuses, etc... are not covered with warranty. As per the norms in the technology industry, warranty will be void under certain circumstances mentioned below in this document under Warranty Terms & Conditions. For example, devices such as Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU (ESP8266, ESP32) have all the GPIO pins at 3.3V TTL level. If you connect an Arduino module with 5V TTL level without properly using level shifters / level convertors or at least dividers, that will easily burn the development board voiding warranty. How to claim warranty? First you need to send an email mentioning/attaching all of the following details to support@tronic.lk Receipt number OR Online Order Reference of the TRONIC.LK Purchase Your wiring diagram A photo taken from top showing the way you have connected wires A clear photo of the item (both sides) showing the physical appearance of it (It must be in the same condition at the time you bought it from us) The voltage you've given to the module Explain the problem you see with the module Once all the above information is supplied and we can't see any issue to help you with, we will ask you to hand over the item to our shop in Kohuwala. You may also send the item to us via\n\nRegistered Post or a courier service. In that case, you need to properly pack the module, include a note with your name, phone number, email address and bill number, pay all the relevant handling charges and send the module to us. We do not pay for parcels coming to our office for warranty claims. Our qualified engineering team will schedule a time, perform an investigation and contact you with their findings. This process will take up to 10 working days excluding weekends, mercantile holidays and travel restriction times.
