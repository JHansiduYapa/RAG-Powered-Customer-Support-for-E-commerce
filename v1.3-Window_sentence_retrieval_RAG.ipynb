That must have been a significant event because it connected her to the tragic events of September 11, 2001. I think the Voss Report was an official document or report by the Department of Defense that analyzed the attacks.\n",

      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any other nicknames or references related to her work or life. She was involved in the 9/11 response, so maybe she had a role in that, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The primary nickname seems to be based on her public last name and initial.\n",

      "I wonder if there are any other notable people with similar nicknames. For example, some people have \"Laurie\" as part of their last names or initials, like Laurie Davenport or Laurie Davenport. But I'm not sure about others. Since the question is specifically about Laurie Voss, I should focus on that.\n",
      "\n",

    "- \"The RAG triad is composed of three RAG evaluation metrics: answer relevancy, faithfulness, and contextual relevancy. If a RAG pipeline scores high on all three metrics, we can confidently say that our RAG pipeline is using the optimal hyperparameters.\"\n",
    "    * Answer relevancy: the answer relevancy metric determines how relevant the answers generated by your RAG generator is. Since LLMs nowadays are getting pretty good at reasoning, it is mainly the prompt template hyperparameter instead of the LLM you are iterating on when working with the answer relevancy metric. To be more specific, a low answer relevnacy score signifies that you need to improve examples used in prompt templates for better in-context learning, or include more fine-grained prompting for better instruction following capabilities to generate more relevant responses.\n",
    "    * Faithfulness: the faithfulness metric determines how much the answers generated by your RAG generator are hallucinations. This concerns the LLM hyperparameter, and you'll want to switch to a different LLM or even fine-tune your own if your LLM is unable to leverage the retrieval context supplied to it to generate grounded answers.\n",
    "    * Contextual Relevancy: the contextual relevancy metric determines whether the text chunks retrieved by your RAG retriever are relevant to producing the ideal answer for a user input. This concerns the chunk size, top-K and embedding model hyperparameter. A good embedding model ensures you're able to retrieve text chunks that are semantically similar to the embedded user query, while a good combination of chunk size and top-K ensures you only select the most important bits of information in your knowledge base."
