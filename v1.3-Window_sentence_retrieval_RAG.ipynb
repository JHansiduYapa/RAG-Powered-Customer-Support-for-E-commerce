I think she ran against Bill Clinton, which is a big deal because Clinton was a major opponent of the Democratic cause. So, Laurie Voss's main campaign was against Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure about the exact years: she was Vice President from 1976 to 2003 and ran for president in 1984. That seems correct. She was also involved in other political activities beyond her presidency, which might have influenced her views on politics or policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting this together into a concise answer. The question is asking who Laurie Voss is and how to write it in 10 words. So I need to capture her role as Vice President, her campaign against Clinton, and perhaps mention her political stance or contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the assistant's response was \"Vice President, former U.S. Secretary of State; ran for president in '84.\" That's 9 words: Vice President, former U.S. Secretary of State; ran for president in '84. But that's only 10 characters if I count each word and the semicolon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check: \"Vice President, former U.S. Secretary of State; ran for president in '84.\" That's 9 words plus the semicolon makes it 10 words. Yeah, that fits the requirement.\n",
      "\n",

    "- \"The RAG triad is composed of three RAG evaluation metrics: answer relevancy, faithfulness, and contextual relevancy. If a RAG pipeline scores high on all three metrics, we can confidently say that our RAG pipeline is using the optimal hyperparameters.\"\n",
    "    * Answer relevancy: the answer relevancy metric determines how relevant the answers generated by your RAG generator is. Since LLMs nowadays are getting pretty good at reasoning, it is mainly the prompt template hyperparameter instead of the LLM you are iterating on when working with the answer relevancy metric. To be more specific, a low answer relevnacy score signifies that you need to improve examples used in prompt templates for better in-context learning, or include more fine-grained prompting for better instruction following capabilities to generate more relevant responses.\n",
    "    * Faithfulness: the faithfulness metric determines how much the answers generated by your RAG generator are hallucinations. This concerns the LLM hyperparameter, and you'll want to switch to a different LLM or even fine-tune your own if your LLM is unable to leverage the retrieval context supplied to it to generate grounded answers.\n",
    "    * Contextual Relevancy: the contextual relevancy metric determines whether the text chunks retrieved by your RAG retriever are relevant to producing the ideal answer for a user input. This concerns the chunk size, top-K and embedding model hyperparameter. A good embedding model ensures you're able to retrieve text chunks that are semantically similar to the embedded user query, while a good combination of chunk size and top-K ensures you only select the most important bits of information in your knowledge base."
